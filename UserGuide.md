##What is Match on the Street?
Match on the Street allows users to create, find, and join sports events spontaneously. It targets both casual and avid sports players who want to be able to connect with other players near them, in real time. Currently, sports meetups are formed based on either the luck of the draw for a simple pick-up game or having already formed a group meetup plan. With Match on the Street, you can find people whenever and wherever you want. In other words, you get all the benefits of long term planning, but none of the guesswork of regular pick up sports.

##Browsing Events
MOTS has two primary ways to browse sporting events that work similarly to Yelp: 
* The Map, where you can visualize the events happening around you or a specific area.
  1. Works just like google maps where you can find your location and see the events around you.
  2. The search bar can be used to see events in a specific location. Eg. searching “Seattle” will display the events around Seattle.
* The List, which allows you to search and filter down events to your liking. 
  1. To apply a filter on search results (e.g. names with “basketball”), tap on the floating action button with the filter icon, and type “basketball” into the search bar.
  2. Selecting an event from the list will bring up another screen with the details of that event. Pressing the back button from here will return you to your search results.
  3. Clicking on the back button or the floating action button with the map icon will bring you back to the map view.

##Creating Events
If you can’t find a sporting event that fits your requirements, you can create your own! Events can be created from either the Map or the List by pressing the create event button on the bottom left of the screen (with a ‘+’  icon). On the create event screen you are able to detail the sporting event in several ways:
* A title (the first thing other people will see, should include name of sport)
* The location of the event 
* A description (any special notes or requirements e.g. need to bring cleats or a ball. Or notes on where to meet.)
* The time and approximate duration of the event 
* The desired range of individuals to attend (e.g. need 6-12 for football) 
* Any other descriptive tags that can be searched 

##Viewing your Events
Opening your profile will allow you to see the events you are attending. To do this swipe from the left-hand side of the screen to bring up the sidebar and tap the “My Events” item. This will bring up a screen that has all the events you are attending and tapping on an event will allow you to view the specific details and unattend the event if desired.
